# Rob's Javascript Styleguidelines (not to be confused with an actual styleguide)

### Language Rules

### Style Rules

#### Commenting
This is the first section as it is one of the most important and sometimes overlooked aspect when writing javascript

A block of code inside a function should be wrapped around a comment block

A start of a comment block is indicated by `//-->` 
An end of a comment block is indicated by `// end //`

Example: 
```
function makeCodeGreatAgain () {
	//--> initializing variables
	var walls, moneys;
	var hair = {};
	// end //
}
```
